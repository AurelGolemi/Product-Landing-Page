# Product-Landing-Page
This project is created with the purpose of developing our skills to the next level using HTML CSS and JavaScript.
The HTML is used to create links to certain sections of the page (offers, new-in, men's clothing etc.), different clothes with photos and links to their display, a search bar to find the product we are looking for. We can do this in multiple languages (english, greek, german) with a wishlist to highlight outfits we like and a chatbot to help the customers with what they need.
We use CSS to style everything accordingly, even for smaller sizes in order to make the site easier to use
The JavaScript has the functionality for everything, starting from this slideshow, the shop the look buttons for each sector (men, women, kids), all the way to the chatbot and the purchase of clothes to the cart and adding them to the wishlist and vice versa.
This project is still in development.
